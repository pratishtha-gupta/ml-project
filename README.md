## 📁 Project List

### 🪨 1. Rock and Mine Prediction

**Notebook**: `project1(rock and mine prediction).ipynb`

#### 🔍 Description:
This project uses **sonar signal data** to classify whether an object is a rock or a mine using machine learning. It involves:

- Data loading and analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

#### 📊 Dataset:
- **Source**: UCI Sonar Dataset
- **Features**: 60 numeric values (energy of sonar signals)
- **Target**: `Rock` or `Mine`

### 🩺 2. Diabetes Prediction

**Notebook**: `project2 diabetes prediction.ipynb`

#### 🔍 Description:
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have **diabetes** based on diagnostic measurements. It covers:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing missing or invalid data
- Model training with classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)
- Performance evaluation

#### 📊 Dataset:
- **Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle / UCI)
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.
- **Target**: `0` (No Diabetes), `1` (Diabetes)
